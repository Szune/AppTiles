# AppTiles
An application to help you remember important files or links you use semi-regularly.

Be even more scatterbrained than before!

![AppTiles example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Szune/AppTiles/master/Example.png)

## Available tile types
- App, which just opens:
  - a program (with arguments if specified)
  - a website (if a url is specified as path)
- Container, which contains even more tiles!
- Note, which is just a place to keep a small amount of information

## How to use
* Left click to perform the tile's action, whether it be opening its container, starting a program, etc.
* Right click to change the type of the tile, edit its layout or reset it, etc.
* Press F6 on the main AppTiles window to save (or save when closing AppTiles).
* Notes can be saved by pressing ctrl + enter.

## TODO
Add search functionality
